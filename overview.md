#Sumo Logic Build Tasks for VSTS

This extension allows you to perform various tasks against the Sumo Logic API.

Currently this extension contains the following two tasks:
- Create Sumo Logic Hosted Collector
- Create Sumo Logic HTTP Source

These two tasks are especially useful when you wish to use a hosted collector, so that application logs can be sent through an HTTP endpoint rather than an installed collector.
